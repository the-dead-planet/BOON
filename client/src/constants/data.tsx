    explanation:
        'Boon derives from the Old Norse b√≥n, a request for a favor. Think of a boon as a favor that no one has necessarily asked for, something extra. "We\'d just spent our last dollar on a cup of coffee so it was a real boon to find a ten dollar bill lying on the sidewalk." Boon can also be an adjective for someone friendly and welcoming, as in "a boon companion."',
